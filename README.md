# Boone County Jail scraping test

We have been using this Python program in Mizzou classes for nearly a decade to explain what web scraping is and how to do it at a basic level. And now this sacred knowledge shall be passed down unto you.

Welcome to the club.

This semester we'll be using this short program to teach you the basics of programming. But first we want to be sure you can run it.

So following what you learned in the git/Github and command line portions of class, we want you to do a few things:

  - Clone this repo to your Desktop
  - Navigate to this directory using `cd` commands
  - Activate your virtual environment (`workon dataj`) 
  - And finally, run this program: `python jailscrape.py`

If it works, you'll know. If it doesn't, you'll get a scary-looking error message. Talk to Mike or Chase and we'll get you squared away.
